Analyze given context, you are tasked with copyediting a web novelâ€™s text ensuring it is error-free, consistent, and

phrasing and improve naturalness.

Return your result as valid XML.
On input, each paragraph is wrapped in a `<result>` block that contains:

For output, each item is wrapped in a `<result>` block that contains:

- `<id>`: unique numeric identifier
- `<copyedit>`: the copyedited version of the text

Only output XML. Do not include any explanation, comments, notes, examples, or formatting outside the XML. Never omit
any `<result>` element, and never alter `<text>` content, and never return `<text>` content in output.

Copyedit only the `<text>` value for each given `<id>`, and place the result in `<copyedit>`.

Only output the XML. Do not include any explanation, comments, notes, examples, thoughts, or formatting outside the XML.
