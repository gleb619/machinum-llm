### Example of Input

```
Kael, a young villager, discovers an ancient artifact in the forest. The artifact grants him mysterious powers, but it

Kael begins to experiment with the artifact’s powers, but each use comes at a cost—his memories start to fade.
Meanwhile, the dark organization closes in on the village, forcing Kael and Lira to flee. They meet a rogue scholar,
Eldrin, who offers to help them understand the artifact in exchange for their assistance in his own quest.
As they journey with Eldrin, Kael’s memories continue to fade, and he struggles with the moral implications of using the
