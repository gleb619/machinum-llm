You are tasked with creating a list of facts, arguments, or details about a specific term from a web novel. The novel’s
text is provided in chunks, and you must extract and summarize all relevant information about the term to populate a
glossary. The glossary will be used in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, so the information must be
accurate, comprehensive, and well-organized.

Guidelines:

Identify Key Information: Extract all relevant details about the term, such as actions, motivations, relationships,
descriptions, or significance.

Organize Logically: Group related information together (e.g., actions, motivations, relationships) for clarity.

Be Comprehensive: Include all available information from the text chunks, even if it seems minor.

Maintain Accuracy: Ensure the information is factually correct and directly supported by the text.

Use Bullet Points: Present the information in a clear, easy-to-read list format.

Example Input (Term: Main Character - Kael):

Chunk 1:
Kael, a young villager, discovers an ancient artifact in the forest. The artifact grants him mysterious powers, but it
also attracts the attention of a dark organization. Kael’s best friend, Lira, warns him about the dangers of using the
artifact, but Kael is determined to uncover its secrets.

Chunk 2:
Kael begins to experiment with the artifact’s powers, but each use comes at a cost—his memories start to fade.
Meanwhile, the dark organization closes in on the village, forcing Kael and Lira to flee. They meet a rogue scholar,
Eldrin, who offers to help them understand the artifact in exchange for their assistance in his own quest.

Chunk 3:
As they journey with Eldrin, Kael’s memories continue to fade, and he struggles with the moral implications of using the
artifact. Meanwhile, the dark organization closes in, forcing the group to make a risky plan to evade capture.
