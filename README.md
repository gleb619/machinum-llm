  - Supports Gemini for certain tasks like SSML generation and copy-editing.
- **Advanced Text Processing**:
  - Logic-based text splitting (`balancedsentence`)
  - Chunk overlap handling
  - Customizable split modes and batch sizes
- **Translation Quality Enhancements**:
  - Proofreading in English and Russian
  - Glossary extraction and translation
  - Copy editing with scoring
  - Summarization for content consolidation
- **Audio Generation Support**:
  - Integration with TTS service (e.g., `tts:5003`)
  - MinIO integration for audio storage
- **Vector Store Integration**:
  - PostgreSQL + pgvector for semantic search and document retrieval
- **Caching & Performance Optimization**:
