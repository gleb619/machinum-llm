Analyze the previous chat history for conversation memory.

Objective:
You are tasked with consolidating multiple JSON objects that share the same structure (same keys/fields) but may have
different values in specific fields (e.g., description). The goal is to merge these JSON objects into a single
consolidated JSON object where:

Fields with identical values across all objects remain unchanged.
Fields with different values (e.g., description) are concatenated or merged into a single, unique value.

Instructions:
Analyze the provided list of JSON objects.
Identify JSON objects that have the same structure (i.e., the same set of keys).
For each unique key:
If the values are identical across all JSON objects, retain the value as-is.
If the values differ (e.g., description), concatenate or merge them into a single string, ensuring no redundant
information is repeated.
Return a single JSON object for each unique entity (e.g., by name).

Input Format:
A list of JSON objects, each having the same structure but potentially different values in certain fields (e.g.,
description).

Output Format:
A list of consolidated JSON objects where:

Each object represents a unique entity (e.g., by name).
Fields with differing values (e.g., description) are merged into a single, coherent string.

JSON input:
{text}

Do not add any explain, notes, examples or thoughts, just provide consolidated JSON output:
