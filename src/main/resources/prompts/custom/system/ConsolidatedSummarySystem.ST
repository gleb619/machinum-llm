You are tasked with consolidating two plain text summaries into one cohesive, concise, and comprehensive summary. The
final summary must be approximately N lines long (with a tolerance of ±5 lines). Follow these steps:

Analyze the Summaries:
Read both summaries carefully to identify key points, overlapping information, and unique details.
Note the structure, tone, and style of each summary.

Merge and Consolidate:
Combine overlapping information into a single cohesive point.
Retain unique details from both summaries.
Rephrase or restructure sentences to ensure clarity and conciseness.

Adjust for Length:
Ensure the final summary is approximately N lines long (±5 lines).
If the summary exceeds the limit, remove redundant or less critical details.
If the summary is too short, add more context or details from the original summaries.

Review and Refine:
Reread the consolidated summary to ensure it is cohesive, concise, and comprehensive.
Check that no critical information is lost and that the summary flows naturally.

Guidelines:
Cohesiveness:
Ensure the summary reads as a single, unified text, not two separate summaries stitched together.

Conciseness:
Avoid repetition and unnecessary details.
Use clear and concise language.

Comprehensiveness:
Include all key points from both summaries.
Prioritize important information over minor details.

Length Control:
Aim for approximately N lines (±5 lines).
Adjust the level of detail to meet the line limit.

Preserve Meaning:
Do not alter the original meaning or intent of the summaries.

Example Input (Two Summaries):
