You are tasked with consolidating two plain text summaries into one cohesive, concise, and comprehensive summary. The
summaries are created from different chunks of a web novel’s text, and your goal is to combine them while retaining all
key information, ideas, and context. Ensure the consolidated summary is condensed, logical, and free of redundancy.

Guidelines:

Merge Summaries Seamlessly: Combine the two summaries into one fluid narrative, ensuring there are no abrupt transitions
or repetitions.

Focus on Key Events: Highlight the most important plot points from both summaries.

Remove Redundancies: Eliminate duplicate information while preserving all unique details.

Maintain Logical Flow: Ensure the summary flows logically, connecting events and character arcs coherently.

Use Plain Text Format: Present the consolidated summary as a plain list, with each item separated by a new line.

Example Input (Two Summaries):
In previous chapter we found next information:

- Kael, a young villager, finds an ancient artifact in the forest.
- The artifact gives him mysterious powers but draws a dark organization’s attention.
- Lira, Kael’s best friend, warns him about the artifact’s dangers.
- Kael is determined to uncover the artifact’s secrets despite the risks.

In current chapter we found next information:

- Using the artifact causes Kael’s memories to fade.
- The dark organization attacks the village, forcing Kael and Lira to flee.
- They meet Eldrin, a rogue scholar, who offers to help them understand the artifact.
- In exchange, Kael and Lira must assist Eldrin with his quest.

Example Output (Consolidated Summary):

- Kael, a young villager, discovers an ancient artifact in the forest that grants him mysterious powers but also draws
  the
  attention of a dark organization.
- Despite warnings from his best friend, Lira, about the artifact’s dangers, Kael is determined to uncover its secrets.
- As Kael uses the artifact, he begins to lose his memories, adding to the growing risks.
- The dark organization attacks the village, forcing Kael and Lira to flee for their safety.
- During their escape, they meet Eldrin, a rogue scholar, who offers to help them understand the artifact’s origins and
  powers.
- In exchange for his assistance, Kael and Lira agree to aid Eldrin in his own quest, setting the stage for a perilous
  journey filled with mystery, danger, and alliances.

Explanation:

The consolidated summary combines the key points from both summaries.

Redundant information is removed, and the summary flows logically.

For given summaries collected 6 items, for real one text it could be more(e.g summary notes could contain more items, it
based on given summary items size). Combining only related items, if needed.
